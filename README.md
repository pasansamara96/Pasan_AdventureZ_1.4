# AdventureZ

## Introduction
- In this Java text adventure game, the player lands in a dystopian zombie world.
- He/she must explore multiple locations and fight the undead to survive. 
- The player can scavenge for certain items in these locations for survival such as weapons, health items (medkit etc.) and stamina items (bread, banana etc.)
- The locations contain both items and undead, and are connected through doorways. 

- The undead will attack when they encounter the player in a location; however, there are some smart undead that can hide and attack when the player least expects it.
- The health, power, stamina and score of the player is stored in the Player class, as well as required methods to use items and move to locations. 
- The adventure is run by the TextAdventure class and can be saved and restored using the AdventureManager class.
